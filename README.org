* vyzo's unofficial r7rs benchmarks for Gerbil

These are just an unofficial run of the benchmarks of my laptop, for
Gerbil v0.18 and Racket v8.6. I did it out of curiousity, as
ecraven's benchmarks seem unmaintained these days.

Take them with a grain of salt; this is vanilla Scheme code, not
idiomatic optimized Gerbil code which can be significantly faster.
I surmize Racket optimized code would be faster too.

You can see them rendered in https://vyzo.github.io/r7rs-benchmarks/
